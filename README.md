# plant_geom_framework  

The repository for the data and analyses for the plant geometric framework project - examining the nutritional landscape of different host plants of Manduca sexta.  

Note that while the master data resides in the repo, the scripts pull data down from the Google Sheets doc - we used this implemntation to run scripts and analyses on the fly before all data was finished being collected.
